Learn Musical Keyboard by tracking EMG Sensor Data

Hand Movements of a player is tracked via Electromyography (EMG) signal to identify the accuracy of keyboard/piano notes an user plays.
Assessment of EMG signal using Machine Learning(ML)/Artificial Intelligence(AI) is to evaluate user performance which helps in self learning of hardware musical instruments.

Step 1 : Collect Emg Data from musicians during their performance
Step 2 : Train AI/ML model using above data
Step 3 : Collect New Player's Data and Evaluate AI/ML model
